          <h2>PhD vacancy on Nonlinear Data Assimilation</h2>
          <p>I am hiring! Are you passionate about advancing the energy transition? Are you curious about methods that will help us to learn more about the subsurface? Together with my colleagues Berent Lunde and Femke Vossepoel, I am looking for a motivated PhD student to join our project on adaptive nonlinear data assimilation in subsurface systems. In this collaboration between Delft University of Technology and Equinor, we will develop an exciting new framework to improve our understanding of complex subsurface environments, crucial for safe drinking water, geothermal energy, and hydrogen storage.

I am looking forward to meet the wider geoscience community here in the Netherlands. Since the statistical nature of my postdoctoral research might be a bit out-of-scope for a geoscience conference, I will present a poster that introduces triangular transport for nonlinear data assimilation.

          <h2>New interactive elements</h2>
          <p>To support my new teaching commitments at TU Delft, I have created two new interactive web-based elements that might help illustrating a few important topics in statistics and linear algebra. <a href="https://www.maxramgraber.com/copula-sandbox">The first</a> shows different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)">copulas</a>, and demonstrates how changing their coefficients affects the copula shape. <a href="https://www.maxramgraber.com/linear-transformation">The second</a> shows how changing the entries of a 2-by-2 matrix affects the resulting linear transformation. Check them out if you are curious, and let me know if you find them useful, run into bugs, or have suggestions for improvements.</p>

          <h2>Smoothing manuscripts published</h2>
          <p>Our two-part manuscript using nonlinear ensemble triangular transport for smoothing has just been published in the open-access Journal of Computational Physics X! If you are curious, you can check out the papers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590055223000124?via%3Dihub">here</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590055223000112?via%3Dihub">here</a>. In Part 1, we discuss how many well-known linear smoothing algorithms emerge as special cases of a general ensemble transport smoother. In Part 2, we discuss generalizations to nonlinear smoothing updates, and demonstrate their performance in nonlinear and chaotic settings. Many thanks to my co-authors Ricardo Baptista (Caltech), Dennis McLaughlin (MIT), and Youssef Marzouk (MIT)! </p>

          <h2>EnKF Workshop in Norheimsund</h2>
          <p>I have just returned from the <a href="https://www.data-assimilation.no/workshops/EnKF-WS-2023">2023 EnKF Workshop</a> in Norheimsund, Norway. During that workshop, I present my recent work on the efficient adaptation of nonlinear transport maps both as an oral talk and an accompanying poster. In brief, our methods allow us to find efficient and parsimonious transport maps for nonlinear data assimilation, which furthermore reveal and exploit conditional independence structure in the system. This permits a very efficient form of adaptive localization. My poster and a recording of my talk can be found in the corresponding sections of my website. I met many interesting people and learned a lot about different areas of data assimilation research at that conference, and can only recommend attending!<br><br> <img style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ySsQgoYAT6ggWltN_Rxtizfp_r6hO8Lu"> </p>

          <h2>Ensemble transport smoothing</h2>
          <p>The pre-prints for my twinned manuscripts about ensemble transport smoothers (EnTS) are now available on arXiv! In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17000">Part 1</a> we introduce the general algorithm, and demonstrate how different existing smoothing algorithms arise as linear special cases of a general nonlinear EnTS. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17435">Part 2</a>, we explore its performance in various nonlinear and chaotic test cases, and match or outperform existing state-of-the-art smoothing algorithms. This work in collaboration with Ricardo Baptista (Caltech), Dennis McLaughlin (MIT), and Youssef Marzouk (MIT) is currently under review in the Journal of Computational Physics.

          <p>I will present some of my work at MIT as a <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/webprogrampreliminary/Paper941401.html">poster</a> in the session on <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/webprogrampreliminary/Session118287.html">Advances in Data Assimilation, Predictability and Uncertainty Quantification</a> at the AGU Fall Meeting in New Orleans this December. This poster will cover the use of transport maps for smoothing, a data assimilation technique similar to filtering, which extends the inference update back to all previous states as well. We find that transport maps offer a unifying perspective on smoothing, from which diverse linear smoothing algorithms can be derived as special cases. We also report nonlinear smoothing results, and show that when it comes to nonlinearity, not all linear smoothers translate equally well to their nonlinear transport extensions. <br><br><br></p>
